# Analysis Objective

## 1. Spending Patterns Analysis
- What are my top spending categories by month/quarter/year?
- How does my spending fluctuate seasonally?
- Which stores/merchants account for the largest portions of my expenses?
- How much am I spending on "wants" vs "needs"?

## 2. Budget vs Actuals
- Where am I consistently over or under budget?
- Which categories have the most variance from my budget?
- How much "rollover" do I have from under-spent categories that could be reallocated?

## 3. Smart Shopping Opportunities
- Where am I making frequent small purchases that could be consolidated?
- Am I paying premium prices for convenience that could be avoided with planning?
- Which categories show price sensitivity where timing purchases could save money?

## 4. Behavioral Insights
- What spending triggers correlate with other life events (paydays, weekends, etc.)?
- How does my spending behavior change when I'm stressed/busy/tired?
- What percentage of my spending is impulsive vs planned?
